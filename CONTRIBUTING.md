# Contributing to ScrapeForge

Thanks for your interest in contributing to **ScrapeForge** — a modular, real-world scraping toolkit designed to solve practical data extraction problems like finding business leads, scraping paginated listings, and more.

We’re building a composable, plug-and-play ecosystem of scraper modules. Your contributions help make it more powerful, flexible, and useful.

## 🧱 Project Structure

scrapeforge/ ├── core/ # Core execution engine and module loader ├── modules/ # Self-contained scraper modules ├── utils/ # Shared helpers (pagination, output formats, etc.) ├── configs/ # Sample configs for different modules

Each module is standalone and follows a consistent `run(config)` pattern. Think of modules like installable “scraping blueprints” for specific use cases.

## ✅ How You Can Contribute

- ✅ Add a new scraper module (e.g. product listings, job boards, open datasets)
- ✅ Improve existing modules (robustness, structure, retries, anti-bot tricks)
- ✅ Extend the core (config-driven execution, logging, proxy rotation)
- ✅ Write documentation, sample configs, or tutorials

## 🔧 Getting Set Up

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_ORG/scrapeforge.git
cd scrapeforge

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run a module
python main.py --module=example_module --config=configs/example.json
🧩 Adding a Scraper Module
Every module must:

Live under modules/your_module_name/

Include a scraper.py file with a run(config: dict) -> list[dict] interface

Optionally include README.md and config_template.json

🔁 Example
python


# scraper.py

def run(config):
    url = config["start_url"]
    response = requests.get(url)
    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, "html.parser")
    
    data = []
    for item in soup.select("div.item"):
        data.append({
            "title": item.select_one(".title").text,
            "link": item.select_one("a")["href"]
        })
    
    return data
Return a list of dictionaries; output handlers will take care of formatting.

⚙️ Core Standards
✅ Output should be structured (list[dict]) — no printing or writing files in modules

✅ Use the built-in utils/ functions where possible

✅ Handle pagination, missing data, and basic anti-bot defenses if applicable

✅ Stick to PEP8 (we use black for formatting)

🧪 Testing
Manual testing is sufficient for now

Run your module using a sample config

Output will be printed or saved via the core runner

🚀 Submitting Your PR
Fork and branch:

bash


git checkout -b add-module-my-module
Add your module and a sample config

Ensure your module runs cleanly and outputs valid JSON

Open a PR with:

Clear module name (e.g. Add scraper for TechCrunch news)

Site scraped and data fields returned

Notes on special handling (pagination, JS, anti-bot, etc.)

📚 Resources
Example modules: runescape, business_directory, job_board

Let me know if you’d like:
- A `scrape_module_template/` generator for new modules  
- A CLI scaffold command like `scrapeforge create-module job_board`  
- GitHub Action to auto-lint or check structure for new PRs
